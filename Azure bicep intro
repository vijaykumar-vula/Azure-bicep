What is Azure Bicep?

As we all know Azure Bicep is domain specific language which can be used to develop resource manager templates. We can use JSON to do the same.
- Bicep will declaratively deploy Azure resources.

            Declarative vs imperative
            
            Declarative code : 
              You'll mention the eng configuration. You won't mention how to accomplish the task. Ex: Bicep, JSON, Ansible, Redhat.
            
            Imperative code : 
              You need to execute a sequence of commands to achieve the eng configuration. In this approach we are mentioning how to accomplish a task. Ex: Azure CLI,
              Azure powershell.

Advantages:
- Simple syntax
- Modules
- Automatic dependency resolution
